<h1 >Lenovo Smart Clock with Google Assistant</h1>

<p >
We're no strangers to interactive screens in the home, between Facebook Portals and Amazon Echos and Google Hubs. The beauty 

of Lenovo's new Smart Clock, then, is its simplicity. It won't video conference or stream TV, but it covers all the bedside bases: 

It tells times, charges phones, and gently wakes you up with a clock face that gradually brightens before your alarm goes off. By 

connecting it to Google Assistant, you can instruct it to do a whole lot more. Small and stylish with its heather gray case, it's an 

unobtrusive and helpful addition.

<h1 >Withings Move Activity and Sleep Watch</h1>

<p>
Withings Move, the new smartwatch from Withings for 2019, monitors your activity and your sleep. It has a GPS tracker and syncs 

with the Health Mate app. It only costs $69.95. Most impressively, it works for 18 months without requiring a battery charge. That, 

and its understated design with an analog clock face, makes it more timeless than a lot of trackers on the market. The customization

options are plentiful too, so you can easily get it to fit your look.

<h1 >Waverly Ambassador Translator</h1>

<p>
Many of us have the misfortune of being cursed with monolingualism. Blame the public school system in America. But for those 

who want to travel regardless of language boundaries—or easily converse with people who speak different languages in their own 

neighborhood—Waverly Labs invented an audio device that translates on the spot. There are many situations in which to use it, but 

perhaps the most useful setup is to attach one to your ear, hand the other to someone who doesn't speak the same language to strap 

onto their own head, and talk away. The correct translation will play in both of your ears. The technology is still in the Indiegogo 

stage, but it might be worth it to you to get your hands on an early version.

<h1 >Ember 14 oz. Temperature Control Mug</h1>

<p>
This mug is a godsend to people who can't function without morning coffee (as in, a large segment of the population). All it does 

is use internal heating technology to keep your caffeinated beverage hot—for an hour. You can nurse coffee without repeated trips 

to the microwave, or steep tea to the ideal temperature (all controlled via a Bluetooth-connected app). And that's all it needs to do. 

While Ember debuted these mugs awhile back, the 14-ounce version is new to 2019, and extremely helpful to your morning routine.

<h1 >Moodo Smart Diffuser Bundle</h1>

<p>
Moodo makes aroma diffusers for the home that can be personalized thanks to four interchangeable scent capsules and smart 

technology you can control from afar; this diffuser has been around for more than a year. Now, Moodo has introduced the MoodoGo 

device, which is easy to cart around because it's tiny. All you need is a USB power supply for it to start dispensing good smells. 

The MoodoGo only holds one scent capsule, but it's a perfect fit for car cupholders and cramped desk spaces. You can't pre-order it 

yet, but you can sign up for updates on the Moodo website. In the meantime, the OG Moodo diffuser (pictured) might tide you over 

with a variety of scent packs to choose from.

<h1>KitchenAid Cook Processor Connect</h1>

<p>
KitchenAid gave U.S. consumers a new kitchen counter appliance to lust after this year: the Cook Processor Connect, a do-it-all 

machine that automatically stirs veggies as they sauté, chops ingredients to your preferred size, kneads dough, steams food, 

measures weight, and more.It also comes programmed with 100 recipes with step-by-step instructions accessed through an app.

 It's like an Instant Pot, but pretty (and expensive). Release date and price were not announced, but expect it to cost well 

over $1,000.
